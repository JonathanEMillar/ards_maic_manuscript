               resource intensive, requiring approximately 1 year from protocol
               registration to submission for publication. Our aim was to
               describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing
               the first 2-week full SR. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We
               systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased
               fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in
               individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by
               experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two
               researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an
               epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and
               blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes
               were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR
               tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer
               feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed
               quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and
               barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and
               peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and
               narratively. RESULTS: The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9
               workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript
               required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16
               person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461
               person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR
               tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis,
               data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks
               were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text
               screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped
               onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory,
               attention, and decision process; environmental context and
               resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer
               reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first
               included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made,
               requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes,
               and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. CONCLUSION: A

               dramatic increase in the number of published genetic association
               studies. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are a common
               method of synthesizing findings and providing reliable estimates
               of the effect of a genetic variant on a trait of interest.
               However, summary estimates are subject to bias due to the
               varying methodological quality of individual studies. We
               embarked on an effort to develop and evaluate a tool that
               assesses the quality of published genetic association studies.
               Performance characteristics (i.e. validity, reliability, and
               item discrimination) were evaluated using a sample of thirty
               studies randomly selected from a previously conducted systematic
               review. RESULTS: The tool demonstrates excellent psychometric
               properties and generates a quality score for each study with
               corresponding ratings of 'low', 'moderate', or 'high' quality.
               We applied our tool to a published systematic review to exclude
               studies of low quality, and found a decrease in heterogeneity
               and an increase in precision of summary estimates. CONCLUSION:
               This tool can be used in systematic reviews to inform the

               disease 2019 (COVID-19). Host genetic variants associated with
               critical illness may identify mechanistic targets for
               therapeutic development3. Here we report the results of the
               GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care) genome-wide
               association study in 2,244 critically ill patients with COVID-19
               from 208 UK intensive care units. We have identified and
               replicated the following new genome-wide significant
               associations: on chromosome 12q24.13 (rs10735079, P = 1.65
               $\times$ 10-8) in a gene cluster that encodes antiviral
               restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3); on
               chromosome 19p13.2 (rs74956615, P = 2.3 $\times$ 10-8) near the
               gene that encodes tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2); on chromosome
               19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 $\times$ 10-12) within the gene
               that encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9); and on chromosome
               21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 $\times$ 10-8) in the interferon
               receptor gene IFNAR2. We identified potential targets for
               repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian
               randomization, we found evidence that low expression of IFNAR2,
               or high expression of TYK2, are associated with life-threatening
               disease; and transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue
               revealed that high expression of the monocyte-macrophage
               chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe COVID-19.
               Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host
               antiviral defence mechanisms and mediators of inflammatory organ
               damage in COVID-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted
               treatment with existing drugs. However, large-scale randomized

               may have a similar function, based on differential gene
               expression analysis or co-expression network analysis. While
               tools have been developed to identify biological processes that
               are enriched in the genes sets, there remains a need for tools
               that identify enrichment of tissue-specific genes. Therefore, we
               developed TissueEnrich, a tool that calculates tissue-specific
               gene enrichment in an input gene set. We demonstrated that
               TissueEnrich can assign tissue identities to single cell
               clusters and differentiated embryonic stem cells. AVAILABILITY

               based on time after initiation of mechanical ventilation for

               OBJECTIVES: To identify genetic susceptibility targets for ARDS.
               METHODS: A genome-wide association study was performed on 232
               African American patients with ARDS and 162 at-risk control
               subjects. The Identify Candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways
               platform was used to infer the association of known gene sets
               with the top prioritized intragenic SNPs. Preclinical validation
               of SELPLG (selectin P ligand gene) was performed using mouse
               models of LPS- and ventilator-induced lung injury. Exonic
               variation within SELPLG distinguishing patients with ARDS from
               sepsis control subjects was confirmed in an independent cohort.
               MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pathway prioritization analysis
               identified a nonsynonymous coding SNP (rs2228315) within SELPLG,
               encoding P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, to be associated with
               increased susceptibility. In an independent cohort, two exonic
               SELPLG SNPs were significantly associated with ARDS
               susceptibility. Additional support for SELPLG as an ARDS
               candidate gene was derived from preclinical ARDS models where
               SELPLG gene expression in lung tissues was significantly
               increased in both ventilator-induced (twofold increase) and
               LPS-induced (5.7-fold increase) murine lung injury models
               compared with controls. Furthermore, Selplg-/- mice exhibited
               significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury
               compared with wild-type C57/B6 mice. Finally, an antibody that
               neutralizes P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 significantly
               attenuated LPS-induced lung inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These
               findings identify SELPLG as a novel ARDS susceptibility gene

              blood leukocyte gene expression is different between the
              ``reactive'' and ``uninflamed'' phenotype. Methods: This is a new
              study adding blood leukocyte transcriptomics and bioinformatics
              analysis to an existing patient cohort of ARDS in patients with
              sepsis admitted to two ICUs during a 1.5-year period. Canonical
              pathway analysis was performed. Measurements and Main Results: A
              total of 210 patients with sepsis and ARDS were included, of whom
              128 had a reactive and 82 an uninflamed phenotype. A total of
              3,332/11,443 (29\%) transcripts were significantly different

               Interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) are a broad gene family
               induced by Type I interferons, often as a response to viral
               infections, which evokes extensive immunomodulation. We tested
               the hypothesis that over- or under-expression of
               immunomodulatory ISG by neutrophils is associated with worse
               clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS. Genome-wide
               transcriptional profiles of circulating neutrophils isolated
               from patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (n = 31) and healthy
               controls (n = 19) were used to characterize ISG expression.
               Hierarchical clustering of expression identified 3 distinct
               subject groups with Low, Mid and High ISG expression. ISG
               accounting for the greatest variability in expression were
               identified (MX1, IFIT1, and ISG15) and used to analyze a
               prospective cohort at the Colorado ARDS Network site. One
               hundred twenty ARDS patients from four urban hospitals were
               enrolled within 72 hours of initiation of mechanical
               ventilation. Circulating neutrophils were isolated from patients
               and expression of ISG determined by PCR. Samples were stratified
               by standard deviation from the mean into High (n = 21), Mid, (n
               = 82) or Low (n = 17) ISG expression. Clinical outcomes were
               compared between patients with High or Low ISG expression to
               those with Mid-range expression. At enrollment, there were no
               differences in age, gender, co-existing medical conditions, or
               type of physiologic injury between cohorts. After adjusting for
               age, race, gender and BMI, patients with either High or Low ISG
               expression had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those
               in the Mid for number of 28-day ventilator- and ICU-free days (P
               = 0.0006 and 0.0004), as well as 90-day mortality and 90-day

               expression in the lungs. Whereas most prior studies focused on
               single proteins, newer methods allowing the simultaneous study
               of many proteins could lead to a better understanding of
               pathogenesis and new targets for treatment. OBJECTIVES: The
               purpose of this study was to examine the changes in protein
               expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of
               patients during the course of the acute respiratory distress
               syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Using two-dimensional difference gel
               electrophoresis (DIGE), the expression of proteins in the BALF
               from patients on Days 1 (n = 7), 3 (n = 8), and 7 (n = 5) of
               ARDS were compared with findings in normal volunteers (n = 9).
               The patterns of protein expression were analyzed using principal
               component analysis (PCA). Biological processes that were
               enriched in the BALF proteins of patients with ARDS were
               identified using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Protein networks
               that model the protein interactions in the BALF were generated
               using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
               An average of 991 protein spots were detected using DIGE. Of
               these, 80 protein spots, representing 37 unique proteins in all
               of the fluids, were identified using mass spectrometry. PCA
               confirmed important differences between the proteins in the ARDS
               and normal samples. GO analysis showed that these differences
               are due to the enrichment of proteins involved in inflammation,
               infection, and injury. The protein network analysis showed that
               the protein interactions in ARDS are complex and redundant, and
               revealed unexpected central components in the protein networks.
               CONCLUSIONS: Proteomics and protein network analysis reveals the
               complex nature of lung protein interactions in ARDS. The results
               provide new insights about protein networks in injured lungs,
               and identify novel mediators that are likely to be involved in
               the pathogenesis and progression of acute lung injury.",

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Despite advances in clinical management, there are
              currently no reliable diagnostic and therapeutic targets for
              acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The
              inflammasome/caspase-1 pathway regulates the maturation and
              secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-18). IL-18 is
              associated with injury in animal models of systemic inflammation.
              OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the contribution of the
              inflammasome pathway in experimental acute lung injury and human
              ARDS. METHODS: We performed comprehensive gene expression
              profiling on peripheral blood from patients with critical
              illness. Gene expression changes were assessed using real-time
              polymerase chain reaction, and IL-18 levels were measured in the
              plasma of the critically ill patients. Wild-type mice or mice
              genetically deficient in IL-18 or caspase-1 were mechanically
              ventilated using moderate tidal volume (12 ml/kg). Lung injury
              parameters were assessed in lung tissue, serum, and
              bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In
              mice, mechanical ventilation enhanced IL-18 levels in the lung,
              serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. IL-18-neutralizing
              antibody treatment, or genetic deletion of IL-18 or caspase-1,
              reduced lung injury in response to mechanical ventilation. In
              human patients with ARDS, inflammasome-related mRNA transcripts
              (CASP1, IL1B, and IL18) were increased in peripheral blood. In
              samples from four clinical centers, IL-18 was elevated in the
              plasma of patients with ARDS (sepsis or trauma-induced ARDS) and
              served as a novel biomarker of intensive care unit morbidity and

               and mortality for acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress
               syndrome (ALI/ARDS) remained high. Particularly, biomarkers
               essential for its early diagnosis and prognosis are lacking.
               METHODS: Recent studies suggest that alveolar macrophages (AMs)
               at the exudative phase of ALI/ARDS initiate, amplify and
               perpetuate inflammatory responses, while they resolve
               inflammation in the recovery phase to prevent further tissue
               injury and perpetuated inflammation in the lung. Therefore,
               proteins relevant to this functional switch could be valuable
               biomarkers for ALI/ARDS diagnosis and prognosis. We thus
               conducted comparative analysis of the AM proteome to assess its
               dynamic proteomic changes during ALI/ARDS progression and
               recovery. RESULTS: 135 proteins were characterized to be
               differentially expressed between AMs at the exudative and
               recovery phase. MALDI-TOF-MS and peptide mass fingerprint (PMF)
               analysis characterized 27 informative proteins, in which 17
               proteins were found with a marked increase at the recovery
               phase, while the rest of 10 proteins were manifested by the
               significantly higher levels of expression at the exudative

               with high morbidity and mortality. Patients undergoing
               allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at
               increased risk for ARDS. We hypothesized that HSCT patients with

               peripheral blood compared to those that did not undergo HSCT.
               METHODS: We isolated RNA from banked peripheral blood samples
               from a biorepository of critically ill ICU patients. RNA-Seq was
               performed on 11 patients with ARDS (5 that had undergone HSCT

               that that had undergone HCST and 7 that had not). RESULTS: We
               identified 687 differentially expressed genes between ARDS and

               better than clinical and inflammatory parameters and may be
               superior for outcome prediction. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
               A training group of patients suffering from ALI/ARDS was
               compiled from equal numbers of survivors and nonsurvivors.
               Clinical history, ventilation parameters, Murray's lung injury
               severity score (Murray's LISS) and interleukins in BALF were
               gathered. In addition, samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
               were analyzed by means of hydrophobic chromatography and
               MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Receiver operating
               characteristic (ROC) analysis for each clinical and cytokine
               parameter revealed interleukin-6>interleukin-8>diabetes
               mellitus>Murray's LISS as the best outcome predictors. Outcome
               predicted on the basis of BALF levels of interleukin-6 resulted
               in 79.4\% accuracy, 82.7\% sensitivity and 76.1\% specificity
               (area under the ROC curve, AUC, 0.853). Both clinical parameters
               and cytokines as well as peptide patterns determined by
               MALDI-ToF MS were analyzed by classification and regression tree
               (CART) analysis and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
               CART analysis including Murray's LISS, interleukin-6 and
               interleukin-8 in combination was correct in 78.0\%. MALDI-ToF MS
               of BALF peptides did not reveal a single identifiable biomarker
               for ARDS. However, classification of patients was successfully
               achieved based on the entire peptide pattern analyzed using SVM.
               This method resulted in 90\% accuracy, 93.3\% sensitivity and
               86.7\% specificity following a 10-fold cross validation (AUC =
               0.953). Subsequent validation of the optimized SVM algorithm
               with a test group of patients with unknown prognosis yielded
               87.5\% accuracy, 83.3\% sensitivity and 90.0\% specificity.
               CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MALDI-ToF MS peptide patterns of BALF,
               evaluated by appropriate mathematical methods can be of value in
               predicting outcome in pneumonia induced ALI/ARDS.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lung
               inflammatory process caused mainly by sepsis. Most previous
               studies that identified genetic risks for ARDS focused on
               candidates with biological relevance. We aimed to identify novel
               genetic variants associated with ARDS susceptibility and to
               provide complementary functional evidence of their effect in
               gene regulation. METHODS: We did a case-control genome-wide
               association study (GWAS) of 1935 European individuals, using
               patients with sepsis-associated ARDS as cases and patients with
               sepsis without ARDS as controls. The discovery stage included
               672 patients admitted into a network of Spanish intensive care
               units between January, 2002, and January, 2017. The replication
               stage comprised 1345 individuals from two independent datasets
               from the MESSI cohort study (Sep 22, 2008-Nov 30, 2017; USA) and
               the VISEP (April 1, 2003-June 30, 2005) and MAXSEP (Oct 1,
               2007-March 31, 2010) trials of the SepNet study (Germany).
               Results from discovery and replication stages were meta-analysed
               to identify association signals. We then used RNA sequencing
               data from lung biopsies, in-silico analyses, and luciferase
               reporter assays to assess the functionallity of associated
               variants. FINDINGS: We identified a novel genome-wide
               significant association with sepsis-associated ARDS
               susceptibility (rs9508032, odds ratio [OR] 0·61, 95\% CI
               0·41-0·91, p=5·18 $\times$ 10-8) located within the Fms-related
               tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) gene, which encodes vascular
               endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1). The region
               containing the sentinel variant and its best proxies acted as a
               silencer for the FLT1 promoter, and alleles with protective
               effects in ARDS further reduced promoter activity (p=0·0047). A
               literature mining of all previously described ARDS genes
               validated the association of vascular endothelial growth factor
               A (VEGFA; OR 0·55, 95\% CI 0·41-0·73; p=4·69 $\times$ 10-5).
               INTERPRETATION: A common variant within the FLT1 gene is
               associated with sepsis-associated ARDS. Our findings support a
               role for the vascular endothelial growth factor signalling
               pathway in ARDS pathogenesis and identify VEGFR-1 as a potential

               develop a gene signature for ALI from gene expression profiles.
               This signature was validated in an independently obtained set of
               patients with ALI + sepsis (n = 8) and sepsis alone (n = 1). An

               studied. OBJECTIVES: To examine the functional and
               transcriptional profiles of patient blood and alveolar
               neutrophils compared with healthy volunteer cells, and to define
               their sensitivity to phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition.
               METHODS: Twenty-three ventilated patients underwent
               bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar and blood neutrophil apoptosis,
               phagocytosis, and adhesion molecules were quantified by flow
               cytometry, and oxidase responses were quantified by
               chemiluminescence. Cytokine and transcriptional profiling were
               used in multiplex and GeneChip arrays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
               RESULTS: Patient blood and alveolar neutrophils were distinct
               from healthy circulating cells, with increased CD11b and reduced
               CD62L expression, delayed constitutive apoptosis, and primed
               oxidase responses. Incubating control cells with disease
               bronchoalveolar lavage recapitulated the aberrant functional
               phenotype, and this could be reversed by phosphoinositide
               3-kinase inhibitors. In contrast, the prosurvival phenotype of
               patient cells was resistant to phosphoinositide 3-kinase
               inhibition. RNA transcriptomic analysis revealed modified
               immune, cytoskeletal, and cell death pathways in patient cells,
               aligning closely to sepsis and burns datasets but not to
               phosphoinositide 3-kinase signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Acute
               respiratory distress syndrome blood and alveolar neutrophils
               display a distinct primed prosurvival profile and
               transcriptional signature. The enhanced respiratory burst was
               phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent but delayed apoptosis and
               the altered transcriptional profile were not. These unexpected
               findings cast doubt over the utility of phosphoinositide
               3-kinase inhibition in acute respiratory distress syndrome and
               highlight the importance of evaluating novel therapeutic
               strategies in patient-derived cells.",

              the intensive care unit within 24 h of admission at a tertiary
              care center. Whole genome expression was compared in patients
              with sepsis and ARDS to patients with sepsis alone. We selected
              genes with >1 log2 fold change and false discovery rate <0.25,
              determined their significance in the literature, and performed
              pathway analysis. Several genes were upregulated in 29 patients

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a
               disease associated with a high mortality rate. The initial phase
               is characterized by induction of inflammatory cytokines and
               chemokines and influx of circulating inflammatory cells,
               including macrophages which play a pivotal role in the innate
               and adaptive immune responses to injury. Growing evidence points
               to phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity between various
               macrophage activation states. METHODS: In this study, gene
               expression in alveolar macrophages and circulating leukocytes
               from healthy control subjects and patients with ARDS was
               assessed by mRNA microarray analysis. RESULTS: Both alveolar
               macrophages and circulating leukocytes demonstrated
               up-regulation of genes encoding chemotactic factors,
               antimicrobial peptides, chemokine receptors, and matrix
               metalloproteinases. Two genes, the pro-inflammatory S100A12 and
               the anti-inflammatory IL-1 decoy receptor IL-1R2 were
               significantly induced in both cell populations in ARDS patients,
               which was confirmed by protein quantification. Although S100A12
               levels did not correlate with disease severity, there was a
               significant association between early plasma levels of IL-1R2
               and APACHE III scores at presentation. Moreover, higher levels
               of IL-1R2 in plasma were observed in non-survivors as compared
               to survivors at later stages of ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: These results
               suggest a hybrid state of alveolar macrophage activation in
               ARDS, with features of both alternative activation and immune
               tolerance/deactivation.. Furthermore, we have identified a novel

               Stage II. rs1868554 was robust to multiple comparison
               correction: odds ratio 1.22 (1.06-1.40), P = 0.0047.
               Resequencing identified predicted novel splice sites in linkage
               disequilibrium with rs1868554, and immunoblots showed higher
               proportion of variant angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) isoform associated
               with rs1868554T (0.81 vs. 0.48; P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: An
               ANGPT2 region is associated with both ALI and variation in
               plasma angiopoietin-2 isoforms. Characterization of the variant
               isoform and its genetic regulation may yield important insights
               about ALI pathogenesis and susceptibility.",

               transcriptional changes in patients with acute respiratory
               distress syndrome (ARDS) could identify cell-specific biological
               programs that are associated with clinical outcomes.Objectives:
               To determine whether AM transcriptional programs are associated
               with prolonged mechanical ventilation and 28-day mortality in
               individuals with ARDS.Methods: We performed genome-wide
               transcriptional profiling of AMs purified from BAL fluid
               collected from 35 subjects with ARDS. Cells were obtained at
               baseline (Day 1), Day 4, and Day 8 after ARDS onset (N = 68
               total samples). We identified biological pathways that were
               enriched at each time point in subjects alive and extubated
               within 28 days after ARDS onset (alive/extubatedDay28) versus
               those dead or persistently supported on mechanical ventilation
               at Day 28 (dead/intubatedDay28).Measurements and Main Results:
               ``M1-like'' (classically activated) and proinflammatory gene
               sets such as IL-6/JAK/STAT5 (Janus kinase/signal transducer and
               activator of transcription 5) signaling were significantly
               enriched in AMs isolated on Day 1 in alive/extubatedDay28 versus
               dead/intubatedDay28 subjects. In contrast, by Day 8, many of
               these same proinflammatory gene sets were enriched in AMs
               collected from dead/intubatedDay28 compared with
               alive/extubatedDay28 subjects. Serially sampled
               alive/extubatedDay28 subjects were characterized by an AM
               temporal expression pattern of Day 1 enrichment of innate immune
               programs followed by prompt downregulation on Days 4 and 8.
               Dead/intubatedDay28 subjects exhibited an opposite pattern,
               characterized by progressive upregulation of proinflammatory
               programs over the course of ARDS. The relationship between AM
               expression profiles and 28-day clinical status was distinct in
               subjects with direct (pulmonary) versus indirect

               effectiveness as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. To identify
               disease-associating variants in ARDS patients, whole-exome
               sequencing was performed on 96 ARDS patients, detecting
               1,382,399 SNPs. By comparing these exome data to those of the

               Considering that PI3 can covalently binding to extracellular

               (Population I; n=765) and pneumonia/pulmonary sepsis (Population
               II; n=838), as causes for ALI/ARDS. Genetic variants replicating

               significantly associated with ARDS from direct/indirect lung
               injury, respectively. The association between rs1190286 (POPDC3)

               (SNP)/insertion-deletion to explore the quantitative and
               functional associations between genetic variants and ICU
               outcome, clinical subphenotypes. Then the lung injury burden
               (LIB), which was defined as the ratio of nonsynonymous SNP
               number per megabase of DNA, was used to evaluate its value in
               predicting ARDS outcome. RESULTS: A total of 105 ARDS patients
               were enrolled in the study, including 70 survivors and 35
               nonsurvivors. Based on the analysis of a total of 65,542
               nonsynonymous SNP, LIB in survivors was significantly higher
               than nonsurvivors [1,892 (1,848-1,942)/MB versus 1,864
               (1,829-1,910)/MB, P=0.018], while GO analysis showed that 60
               functions were correlated with ARDS outcome, KEGG enrichment
               analysis showed that SNP/InDels were enriched in 13 pathways.
               Several new SNPs were found potentially associated with ARDS
               outcome. Analysis of LIB was used to determine its outcome
               predicting ability, the area under the ROC curve of which was
               only 0.6103, and increase to 0.712 when combined with APACHE II
               score. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants are associated with ARDS
               outcome and subphenotypes; however, their prognostic value still
               need to be verified by larger trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

              genes in ARDS. A total of 679 valid sequences were identified as

               a cohort of ARDS patients and critically ill at-risk controls.
               Whole blood miRNA profiles and logistic regression analyses
               identified miRNAs correlated with ARDS. Stratification analysis
               also assessed selected miRNA markers for their role in sepsis
               and pneumonia associated with ARDS. Receiver operating
               characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated miRNA diagnostic
               performance, along with Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS).
               RESULTS: Statistical analyses were performed on 294 miRNAs,
               selected from 754 miRNAs after quality control screening.
               Logistic regression identified 22 miRNAs from a 156-patient
               discovery cohort as potential risk or protective markers of
               ARDS. Three miRNAs-miR-181a, miR-92a, and miR-424-from the
               discovery cohort remained significantly associated with ARDS in
               a 373-patient independent validation cohort (FDR q < 0.05) and
               meta-analysis (p < 0.001). ROC analyses demonstrated a LIPS
               baseline area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of ARDS of 0.708 (95\%
               CI 0.651-0.766). Addition of miR-181a, miR-92a, and miR-424 to

  abstract = "AbstractA common experimental output in biomedical science is a
              list of genes implicated in a given biological process or
              disease. The results of a group of studies answering the same, or
              similar, questions can be combined by meta-analysis to find a
              consensus or a more reliable answer. Ranking aggregation methods
              can be used to combine gene lists from various sources in
              meta-analyses. Evaluating a ranking aggregation method on a
              specific type of dataset before using it is required to support
              the reliability of the result since the property of a dataset can
              influence the performance of an algorithm. Evaluation of
              aggregation methods is usually based on a simulated database
              especially for the algorithms designed for gene lists because of
              the lack of a known truth for real data. However, simulated
              datasets tend to be too small compared to experimental data and
              neglect key features, including heterogeneity of quality,
              relevance and the inclusion of unranked lists. In this study, a
              group of existing methods and their variations which are suitable

               to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the
               results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds
               functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are
               statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally,
               the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes
               in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the
               increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many
               current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.
               PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in
               the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed
               ``Enrichment Map'', a network-based visualization method for
               gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a
               network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene
               overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related
               gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly
               identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily
               interpret the enrichment results. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment Map is
               a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment
               analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes
               can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment

               definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS
               based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 $\leq$
               300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 $\leq$ 200 mm Hg),
               and severe (PaO2/FIO2 $\leq$ 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary
               variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory
               system compliance ($\leq$40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory
               pressure ($\geq$10 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per
               minute ($\geq$10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was
               empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188
               patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269
               patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing
               physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not
               contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for
               mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin
               Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were
               associated with increased mortality (27\%; 95\% CI, 24\%-30\%;
               32\%; 95\% CI, 29\%-34\%; and 45\%; 95\% CI, 42\%-48\%,
               respectively; P < .001) and increased median duration of
               mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile
               [IQR], 2-11; 7 days; IQR, 4-14; and 9 days; IQR, 5-17,
               respectively; P < .001). Compared with the AECC definition, the
               final Berlin Definition had better predictive validity for
               mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve of
               0.577 (95\% CI, 0.561-0.593) vs 0.536 (95\% CI, 0.520-0.553; P <
               .001). This updated and revised Berlin Definition for ARDS
               addresses a number of the limitations of the AECC definition.
               The approach of combining consensus discussions with empirical
               evaluation may serve as a model to create more accurate,
               evidence-based, critical illness syndrome definitions and to
               better inform clinical care, research, and health services

  abstract = "IMPORTANCE: Limited information exists about the epidemiology,
              recognition, management, and outcomes of patients with the acute
              respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
              intensive care unit (ICU) incidence and outcome of ARDS and to
              assess clinician recognition, ventilation management, and use of
              adjuncts-for example prone positioning-in routine clinical
              practice for patients fulfilling the ARDS Berlin Definition.
              DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Large Observational Study
              to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory
              Failure (LUNG SAFE) was an international, multicenter,
              prospective cohort study of patients undergoing invasive or
              noninvasive ventilation, conducted during 4 consecutive weeks in
              the winter of 2014 in a convenience sample of 459 ICUs from 50
              countries across 5 continents. EXPOSURES: Acute respiratory
              distress syndrome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary
              outcome was ICU incidence of ARDS. Secondary outcomes included
              assessment of clinician recognition of ARDS, the application of
              ventilatory management, the use of adjunctive interventions in
              routine clinical practice, and clinical outcomes from ARDS.
              RESULTS: Of 29,144 patients admitted to participating ICUs, 3022
              (10.4\%) fulfilled ARDS criteria. Of these, 2377 patients
              developed ARDS in the first 48 hours and whose respiratory
              failure was managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. The
              period prevalence of mild ARDS was 30.0\% (95\% CI,
              28.2\%-31.9\%); of moderate ARDS, 46.6\% (95\% CI,
              44.5\%-48.6\%); and of severe ARDS, 23.4\% (95\% CI,
              21.7\%-25.2\%). ARDS represented 0.42 cases per ICU bed over 4
              weeks and represented 10.4\% (95\% CI, 10.0\%-10.7\%) of ICU
              admissions and 23.4\% of patients requiring mechanical
              ventilation. Clinical recognition of ARDS ranged from 51.3\%
              (95\% CI, 47.5\%-55.0\%) in mild to 78.5\% (95\% CI,
              74.8\%-81.8\%) in severe ARDS. Less than two-thirds of patients
              with ARDS received a tidal volume 8 of mL/kg or less of predicted
              body weight. Plateau pressure was measured in 40.1\% (95\% CI,
              38.2-42.1), whereas 82.6\% (95\% CI, 81.0\%-84.1\%) received a
              positive end-expository pressure (PEEP) of less than 12 cm H2O.
              Prone positioning was used in 16.3\% (95\% CI, 13.7\%-19.2\%) of
              patients with severe ARDS. Clinician recognition of ARDS was
              associated with higher PEEP, greater use of neuromuscular
              blockade, and prone positioning. Hospital mortality was 34.9\%
              (95\% CI, 31.4\%-38.5\%) for those with mild, 40.3\% (95\% CI,
              37.4\%-43.3\%) for those with moderate, and 46.1\% (95\% CI,
              41.9\%-50.4\%) for those with severe ARDS. CONCLUSIONS AND
              RELEVANCE: Among ICUs in 50 countries, the period prevalence of
              ARDS was 10.4\% of ICU admissions. This syndrome appeared to be
              underrecognized and undertreated and associated with a high
              mortality rate. These findings indicate the potential for
              improvement in the management of patients with ARDS. TRIAL

               infection with SARS-CoV-2. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality

               individuals who are critically ill with those of population
               controls to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here we use
               whole-genome sequencing in 7,491 critically ill individuals
               compared with 48,400 controls to discover and replicate 23
               independent variants that significantly predispose to critical
               COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including
               variants within genes that are involved in interferon signalling
               (IL10RB and PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A) and
               blood-type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using
               transcriptome-wide association and colocalization to infer the
               effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence
               that implicates multiple genes-including reduced expression of a
               membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased expression of a mucin
               (MUC1)-in critical disease. Mendelian randomization provides
               evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion
               molecules (SELE, ICAM5 and CD209) and the coagulation factor F8,
               all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are
               broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19
               pathophysiology, in which at least two distinct mechanisms can
               predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral
               replication; or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary
               inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that
               comparison between cases of critical illness and population
               controls is highly efficient for the detection of
               therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a
              life-threatening condition characterized by hypoxemia and poor
              lung compliance, is associated with high mortality. ARDS induced
              by COVID-19 has similar clinical presentations and pathological
              manifestations as non-COVID-19 ARDS. However, COVID-19 ARDS is
              associated with a more protracted inflammatory respiratory
              failure compared to traditional ARDS. Therefore, a comprehensive
              molecular comparison of ARDS of different etiologies groups may
              pave the way for more specific clinical interventions. METHODS
              AND FINDINGS: In this study, we compared COVID-19 ARDS (n = 43)
              and bacterial sepsis-induced (non-COVID-19) ARDS (n = 24) using
              multi-omic plasma profiles covering 663 metabolites, 1,051
              lipids, and 266 proteins. To address both between- and within-
              ARDS group variabilities we followed two approaches. First, we
              identified 706 molecules differently abundant between the two
              ARDS etiologies, revealing more than 40 biological processes
              differently regulated between the two groups. From these
              processes, we assembled a cascade of therapeutically relevant
              pathways downstream of sphingosine metabolism. The analysis
              suggests a possible overactivation of arginine metabolism
              involved in long-term sequelae of ARDS and highlights the
              potential of JAK inhibitors to improve outcomes in bacterial
              sepsis-induced ARDS. The second part of our study involved the
              comparison of the two ARDS groups with respect to clinical
              manifestations. Using a data-driven multi-omic network, we
              identified signatures of acute kidney injury (AKI) and
              thrombocytosis within each ARDS group. The AKI-associated network
              implicated mitochondrial dysregulation which might lead to
              post-ARDS renal-sequalae. The thrombocytosis-associated network
              hinted at a synergy between prothrombotic processes, namely
              IL-17, MAPK, TNF signaling pathways, and cell adhesion molecules.
              Thus, we speculate that combination therapy targeting two or more
              of these processes may ameliorate thrombocytosis-mediated
              hypercoagulation. CONCLUSION: We present a first comprehensive
              molecular characterization of differences between two ARDS
              etiologies-COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis. Further investigation
              into the identified pathways will lead to a better understanding

              therapeutic interventions.",

               syndrome (ARDS), an often-fatal complication of pulmonary or

               impact on immune responses, is often neglected. In the present

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common
               complication in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and can
               lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Identifying protein
               profiles specific to VAP in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
               may aid in earlier diagnosis, elucidate mechanisms of disease,
               and identify putative targets for therapeutic intervention.
               METHODS: BALF was obtained from 5 normal subjects and 30 ALI
               patients: 14 with VAP (VAP(+)) and 16 without VAP (VAP(-)). Each
               sample underwent shotgun proteomic analysis based on tandem mass
               spectrometry. Differentially expressed proteins between the
               groups were identified using statistical methods based on
               spectral counting. Mechanisms of disease were explored using
               functional annotation and protein interaction network analysis.
               Supervised classification algorithms were implemented to
               discover a proteomic classifier for identifying critically ill
               patients with VAP. RESULTS: ALI patients had distinct BALF
               proteomic profiles compared to normal controls. Within the ALI
               group, we identified 76 differentially expressed proteins
               between VAP(+) and VAP(-). Functional analysis of these proteins
               suggested activation of pro-inflammatory pathways during VAP. We
               identified and validated a limited proteomic signature that
               discriminated VAP(+) from VAP(-) patients comprised of three
               proteins: S100A8, lactotransferrin (LTF), and actinin 1 (ACTN1).
               CONCLUSIONS: Combining proteomic with computational analyses is
               a powerful approach to study the BALF proteome during lung
               injury and development of VAP. This integrative methodology is a
               promising strategy to differentiate clinically relevant subsets
               of ALI patients, including those suffering from VAP.",

               syndrome (ARDS) has made considerable progress. However, ARDS

               ARDS presents distinct subphenotypes with different clinical and
               biological features. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of ARDS may
               contribute to the biological variability and partially explain

Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has successfully depicted cellular heterogeneity in human tissue, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand the context-specific expression of complex trait-associated genes in human tissue-cell types (TCs). Here, we present the first web-based application to quickly assess the cell-type-specificity of genes, named Web-based Cell-type Specific Enrichment Analysis of Genes (WebCSEA, available at https://bioinfo.uth.edu/webcsea/). Specifically, we curated a total of 111 scRNA-seq panels of human tissues and 1,355 TCs from 61 different general tissues across 11 human organ systems. We adapted our previous decoding tissue-specificity (deTS) algorithm to measure the enrichment for each tissue-cell type (TC). To overcome the potential bias from the number of signature genes between different TCs, we further developed a permutation-based method that accurately estimates the TC-specificity of a given inquiry gene list. WebCSEA also provides an interactive heatmap that displays the cell-type specificity across 1355 human TCs, and other interactive and static visualizations of cell-type specificity by human organ system, developmental stage, and top-ranked tissues and cell types. In short, WebCSEA is a one-click application that provides a comprehensive exploration of the TC-specificity of genes among human major TC map.}",

Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},
